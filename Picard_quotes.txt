PICARD: Stand by for Commander Riker, Chief. He's on his way.
PICARD: Since you're concerned about these tests.
PICARD: Very good.
PICARD: Engineering, this is the Bridge. It's your call.
PICARD [OC]: La Forge, set in warp one point five.
PICARD: Engage.
PICARD: Reverse engines.
PICARD: Because no one has gone this fast. Reverse engines.
PICARD: All stop.
PICARD: Position, Mister La Forge.
PICARD: I can't accept that.
PICARD: Just explain what brought us here.
PICARD: Considering where we are, we must assume it isn't.
PICARD: Commander Riker will join you in a moment.
PICARD [OC]: Standing by, Number One.
PICARD: Begin at warp one point five.
PICARD: All stop.
PICARD: Yes, I've felt that. But why now, suddenly.
PICARD: I had to get everyone's attention. It was the quickest way.
PICARD: He mustn't. He's the only one who can get us back.
PICARD: Wake him.
PICARD: We don't have that luxury. Wake him.
PICARD: Doctor. Wes. We all have other friends aboard this ship, too.
PICARD: Do you recognise me? I'm the Captain and I need answers.
PICARD: That's not an answer.
PICARD: Until now.
PICARD: Chaos. What we think is what happens.
PICARD: Revive him.
PICARD: Unless he was distracted by something.
PICARD: Strange how he seems to care for you.
PICARD: Somewhat.
PICARD: We're going to get back home. Take him to Engineering.
PICARD: I'll be on the Bridge.
PICARD: Think! Put the flame out in your thoughts.
PICARD: Now, Get to your station and concentrate on your assignment.
PICARD: All decks, all stations.
PICARD: All decks, all stations. Battle stations.
PICARD: Bridge to Engineering. Stand by.
PICARD: On my order, Mister Data, Mister La Forge. Engage.
PICARD: It's not happening. It's not enough.
PICARD: Cease Red Alert.
PICARD: Please don't interrupt me, Wesley.
PICARD: Meanwhile, you can sit here and learn something.
