# MissiontoMars

MissiontoMars is a fun, coffee-break app for Star Trek and space exploration fans fascinated with new frontiers and the possibilities of exploring Mars. Users can click on one of the 3 NASA Rovers - Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity - and select by date to see a photo of Mars taken by the rover. A randomised mission log is generated that creates a fictionalised story (taken from Star Trek scripts) around the rovers. Users can also view and search the archive of mission logs that are saved to the database. Once a user registers, they are automatically signed up for a weekly automated newsletter. Users can also see a quote of the day - webscrapped from Start Trek Next Generation fan sites.
