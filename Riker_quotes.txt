RIKER: He is engaged in other duties, sir.
RIKER: You're from Tau Alpha C. That's very distant.
RIKER: I'll have our Chief Engineer show you to his Engine Room.
RIKER: One thing that Kosinski isn't hiding, his bad disposition.
RIKER: You have all the time you need.
RIKER: But it hasn't been approved by the Chief Engineer or by me.
RIKER: Now you do.
RIKER: If you like. It won't change anything.
RIKER: I'll leave that to you.
RIKER: We are.
RIKER: We're still trying to determine what happened, sir.
RIKER: Aye, sir, it is. But as they say, sir, you're the Captain.
RIKER: Aye, sir.
RIKER: Not now, Wes.
RIKER: Aye, sir.
RIKER: We're ready for you to engage, Captain.
RIKER: It wasn't him. It never was. It was his assistant.
RIKER: Kosinski wasn't the one controlling the warp experiments.
RIKER: The equations he punched in were nonsense, just as we thought.
RIKER: Wesley did.
RIKER: He tried, twice. I didn't listen.
RIKER: And allowing Kosinski to take credit for what you did.
RIKER: And you have this ability to travel.
RIKER: Yes, sir.
RIKER: Yes, sir.
RIKER [OC]: Engineering to Bridge, we're ready.
RIKER: The Traveller's gone, sir.
RIKER: Wesley Crusher, report to the Bridge, on the double.
RIKER: Yes, sir.
RIKER: Captain, it's not allowed. Your orders.
RIKER: That would give him authorised access to the Bridge.
RIKER: Aye, sir.
