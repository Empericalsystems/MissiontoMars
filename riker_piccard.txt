PICARD: Stand by for Commander Riker, Chief. He's on his way.
PICARD: Since you're concerned about these tests.
PICARD: Very good.
PICARD: Engineering, this is the Bridge. It's your call.
PICARD [OC]: La Forge, set in warp one point five.
PICARD: Engage.
PICARD: Reverse engines.
PICARD: Because no one has gone this fast. Reverse engines.
PICARD: All stop.
PICARD: Position, Mister La Forge.
PICARD: I can't accept that.
PICARD: Just explain what brought us here.
PICARD: Considering where we are, we must assume it isn't.
PICARD: Commander Riker will join you in a moment.
PICARD [OC]: Standing by, Number One.
PICARD: Begin at warp one point five.
PICARD: All stop.
PICARD: Yes, I've felt that. But why now, suddenly.
PICARD: I had to get everyone's attention. It was the quickest way.
PICARD: He mustn't. He's the only one who can get us back.
PICARD: Wake him.
PICARD: We don't have that luxury. Wake him.
PICARD: Doctor. Wes. We all have other friends aboard this ship, too.
PICARD: Do you recognise me? I'm the Captain and I need answers.
PICARD: That's not an answer.
PICARD: Until now.
PICARD: Chaos. What we think is what happens.
PICARD: Revive him.
PICARD: Unless he was distracted by something.
PICARD: Strange how he seems to care for you.
PICARD: Somewhat.
PICARD: We're going to get back home. Take him to Engineering.
PICARD: I'll be on the Bridge.
PICARD: Think! Put the flame out in your thoughts.
PICARD: Now, Get to your station and concentrate on your assignment.
PICARD: All decks, all stations.
PICARD: All decks, all stations. Battle stations.
PICARD: Bridge to Engineering. Stand by.
PICARD: On my order, Mister Data, Mister La Forge. Engage.
PICARD: It's not happening. It's not enough.
PICARD: Cease Red Alert.
PICARD: Please don't interrupt me, Wesley.
PICARD: Meanwhile, you can sit here and learn something.
RIKER: He is engaged in other duties, sir.
RIKER: You're from Tau Alpha C. That's very distant.
RIKER: I'll have our Chief Engineer show you to his Engine Room.
RIKER: One thing that Kosinski isn't hiding, his bad disposition.
RIKER: You have all the time you need.
RIKER: But it hasn't been approved by the Chief Engineer or by me.
RIKER: Now you do.
RIKER: If you like. It won't change anything.
RIKER: I'll leave that to you.
RIKER: We are.
RIKER: We're still trying to determine what happened, sir.
RIKER: Aye, sir, it is. But as they say, sir, you're the Captain.
RIKER: Aye, sir.
RIKER: Not now, Wes.
RIKER: Aye, sir.
RIKER: We're ready for you to engage, Captain.
RIKER: It wasn't him. It never was. It was his assistant.
RIKER: Kosinski wasn't the one controlling the warp experiments.
RIKER: The equations he punched in were nonsense, just as we thought.
RIKER: Wesley did.
RIKER: He tried, twice. I didn't listen.
RIKER: And allowing Kosinski to take credit for what you did.
RIKER: And you have this ability to travel.
RIKER: Yes, sir.
RIKER: Yes, sir.
RIKER [OC]: Engineering to Bridge, we're ready.
RIKER: The Traveller's gone, sir.
RIKER: Wesley Crusher, report to the Bridge, on the double.
RIKER: Yes, sir.
RIKER: Captain, it's not allowed. Your orders.
RIKER: That would give him authorised access to the Bridge.
RIKER: Aye, sir.
