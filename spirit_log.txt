TROI: I am.
TROI: I was certain it would never happen, Captain.
TROI: No, sir.

TROI: This is why you were surprised when you first saw me. This woman.

TROI: Wyatt, I'm happy for you, and for Ariana too.
TROI: Mother.
TROI: Goodbye.
TROI: He has other obligations, Mother.
TROI: That was meant as a joke, Captain.
