            The mission: Colonise Mars for their human creators. <br>
            Spirit and Opportunity, the geologist twins were first to arrive. 
            Their research was going well.
            They knew each other's quirks and weaknesses. 
            The days were long, the nights freezing. But it was a quiet, peaceful existence. And they were consumed in their work.
            <p></p>
            <p>And then Curiosity arrived. <br></p>
            A newer, faster, smarter AI.
            Opportunity felt ploddingly slow in his explorations and Spirit? Well, she didn't mind Curiosity... 
            But early analysis of Curiosity's soil samples immediately showed that there were traces of water on the planet.
            And then...then they started seeing evidence of other life forms. <br>
            That's the point when their mission changed - from colinisation to surivial.

          <p>She beat her twin, Opportunity, to Mars by a few days. But Spirit's not the competitive type. She's serious

          <p>One of the geologist twins. He arrived on Mars after his sister, Spirit. He lasted much longer than anyone,
